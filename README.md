Ignition-Core
=============

This module provides command-line tools to launch clusters and jobs (`core/tools/cluster.py`).

It also provides many utilities for Spark jobs and Scala programs in general.

It should be used inside a project as a submodule. See https://github.com/chaordic/ignition-template for an example.
